Fractional based grid contains one-whole, halves, thirds, quarters, fifths, sixths, eighths, tenths, twelfths.

The grid is composable by nature allowing you to nest anything within grid items, that includes but not limited
to grids, flags, cards - literally anything!  This composable nature allows an infinite number of layout combinations.

It's fully responsive and highly customisable as the provided options here demonstrate.

Umlike some other grids it does not break when it's items are of differing heights when they are intended to tile.

### Note
It is not recommended that you augment the grid elements with additional styling, instead we encourage you to nest
other elements inside and style them.  As you can see in this example we have nested the `<Card />` component within.
