As a consumer of Nebula you get to choose which layer(s) your project includes:

### [Nebula CSS](https://github.com/rbrtsmith/nebula-css)
A very low level CSS/Sass architecture using ITCSS and BEM, includes all of the Object examples on this site.
It ships without any cosmetic styling leaving it upto you to configure your own typography, colours and so on.

### [Nebula Components](https://github.com/rbrtsmith/nebula-components)
Building upon Nebula CSS this is a collection of components that are cosmetically themed,
also ships with responsive typography defaults and colours.  By it's very nature this layer is  much more opinionated
than Nebula CSS.  Some of the components require you to add in JavaScript functionality for the user interactions.

### [Nebula React](https://github.com/rbrtsmith/nebula-react)
ReactJS components for the Objects that ship with Nebula CSS and Components that ship with Nebula Components.  As the
illustration above depicts Nebula React requires either Nebula CSS or both Nebula CSS and Nebula Components to function
properly.
