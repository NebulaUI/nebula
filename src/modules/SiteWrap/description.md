* Site Wrap is a content container that typically wraps the main content of an app or website.
* Anything can be nested inside of Site Wrap, images, test, any other component.

### Note
Due to the content of this application already being nested inside of a SiteWrap the padding on the demonstration here
is more than would be if used in isolation.  You would not normally nest Site Wrap objects inside of one another.
